Build a Machine Learning model to predict the most suitable crop to grow on a particular farm.

Agriculture plays a predominant role in the economy and employment of a country. The common problem existing among the farmers is they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. Due to this, they face a serious setback in productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. 


Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters. This reduces the wrong choice when it comes to crop selection, and also increases productivity.

about the dataset:

This dataset was built by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.

P - ratio of Phosphorus content in soil

K - ratio of Potassium content in soil

temperature - temperature in degree Celsius

humidity - relative humidity in %

ph - ph value of the soil

rainfall - rainfall in mm

crop - Suitable crop to grow (target variable)
